## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

### Technologies Used

- **Next.js 15.5.2** with Turbopack
- **React Hook Form** for form management
- **Zod** for validation schemas
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **shadcn/ui** components
- **Lucide React** for icons

### Key Files

- `src/lib/form-schema.js` - Validation schemas and business rules
- `src/data/mockData.js` - Centralized mock data (managers, skills, departments, etc.)
- `src/components/MultiStepForm.jsx` - Main form orchestration
- `src/components/form-steps/` - Individual step components (simplified)
- `src/components/ui/` - Reusable UI components
- `src/hooks/` - Custom hooks for validation and navigation (simplified)

### Validation Strategy

- **Step-level validation**: Each step has its own schema
- **Cross-step validation**: Full form validation on submit
- **Real-time validation**: onChange mode for immediate feedback
- **Conditional validation**: Dynamic rules based on form state
